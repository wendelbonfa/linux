Required properties:

  - compatible: "atheros,ath6kl"

Optional properties:

  - digi,pwrdown-gpios: GPIOs used to power down the wireless chip.
  - digi,pwrdown_delay: Delay in ms between power down GPIO toggling.
  - ath6kl-p2p-enable: boolean to enable driver's 'p2p' support (wifi direct).
  - ath6kl-softmac-enable: boolean to enable setting interface's MAC address
                           from 'softmac' firmware file.

Example:

	wireless {
		compatible = "atheros,ath6kl"
		ath6kl-p2p-enable;
		ath6kl-softmac-enable;
		digi,pwrdown-gpios = <&gpio_extender 3 0>;
		digi,pwrdown_delay = <5>;
		/* U-Boot will fill in the MAC address here */
	};
